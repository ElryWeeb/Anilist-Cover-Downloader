# Download Series Thumbnails from Anilist
I made this for my Manga Library so i could get a cover for all my Manga fast.

## Usage
Set up a Textfile called Manga.txt with all Manga names seperated by Linebreaks.

Download the exe from Releases and open it.
## Fuck
I wasted way too much time for this, i could have downloaded all images manually in half the time.
